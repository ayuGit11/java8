First programming used lamda expressions is LISP.

The main objective of lamda Expressions is to bring benefits of functional programming in java.
lamda expressions: It is an annonymous function.
                               |
              (nameless,without return type,without modifiers)

eg1:                                                                   In lamda expression
public void m1(){
   System.out.println("Hello");     --------->               ()-> {System.out.println("Hello");};  (If only one statement is there then we can remove curly braches)
}                                                            ()-> System.out.println("Hello");


eg2:
public void m1(int a,int b){
   System.out.println(a+b);        ---------->               (a,b)-> System.out.println(a+b);
}  

we can call normal methods by its name like m1(2,4)  but how we can call lambda expressions?? 
So the answer is by using functional Interface.
So for calling lamda expression we reqire Functional Interface.
