 Java 8 or JDK 8.0 is one of the major releases of the Java programming language in 2014. It is also known by the codename Spider. Java is an open-source project and is currently managed by Oracle Corporation.

 === Concise code: By enabling functional programming.(we can write less lines of code)
 1.lamda expression
 
 before java8:   public static void main(String args[]){                   After java8:    import java.util.Function.*;  
                                                                                            public static void main(String args[]){
                     System.out.println(square(4));                                             Function<Intger,Integer> f = i->i*i;
                  }                                                                             System.out.println(f.apply(4));
                  public static int square(int n){                                          }
                     return n*n;
                  }
